The Municipal Commission proposed its construction in July 1902 and the Westminster Construction Company of London was awarded the contract in March 1907. The reservoir was completed in 1910, at a cost of 967,641 Straits dollars, by damming the upper reaches of the Kallang River and was officially opened on 26 March 1912. Ten years later, the reservoir was renamed the Peirce Reservoir in recognition of Robert Peirce, who was the Municipal Engineer of Singapore from 1901 to 1916.

The largest of the nature reserves in Singapore, the Central Catchment Nature Reserve occupies over 2,000 hectares of forest cover and is home to some of the richest forests in terms of biodiversity.\r\n\r\nDipterocarp forests, which are species-rich primary lowland forests, were once abundant in Singapore before human settlements developed. Today, less than 0.5% of the original primary forest cover remains and it can only be found in small patches within the Central Catchment Nature Reserve and the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. An even rarer forest type in Singapore is the primary freshwater swamp forest, with the most significant remaining patch being the Nee Soon Swamp Forest in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.\r\n\r\nThe existing habitats are home to a magnificent diversity of plants. Examples include the Keruing (Dipterocarpus spp.) and Meranti (Shorea spp.) as well as the critically endangered Raffles Banded Langur (Presbytis femoralis) and the Sunda Pangolin (Manis javanica).\r\n\r\nCome and experience their beauty on the carefully planned nature trails. The MacRitchie Trails are a 20-kilometre network of trails and boardwalks winding through the forest around the MacRitchie Reservoir. Key attractions of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve include the TreeTop Walk, a 250-metre suspension bridge that connects the two highest points in MacRitchie and the Jelutong Tower, a 7-deck observation tower that allows visitors an unimpeded overview of the forest in MacRitchie.\r\n\r\nThe Central Catchment Nature Reserve and the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve once formed a contiguous forest. That all changed when the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) was constructed in 1986, separating the nature reserves into two fragments. The Eco-Link@BKE, completed in 2013, now connects the two reserves once again to facilitate animal movements and the dispersal of forest plant seeds.\r\n\r\nMacRitchie Reservoir Park is located at the southern-eastern end of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and is highly visited by nature lovers and sports enthusiasts.
